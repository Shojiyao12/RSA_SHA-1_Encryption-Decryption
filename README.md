## Quickstart Guide
1. Copy all the contents from this repository.
2. Open the CMSC125MP2.java file using an IDE, like NetBeans or Eclipse.
3. Run the CMSC125MP2.java file
   - Upon running the file, the program should prompt you to select a certain method to be used, either RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) for encryption/decryption or SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) for hashing, and when you are done simply input 'exit' to leave the program.

## Core Concept
- Introduction to Computer Security and Protection

### Note: 
This program also accepts string characters (A-Z, a-z) as an input, other than numbers (0-9) only, or even a combination of both (numbers and strings).
